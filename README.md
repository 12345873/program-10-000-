# program (10,000)
" Your first 10,000 photographs are your worst" ~Henri Cartier-Bresson. So, I will create my 10,000 "worst" programs.

# what type programs:
  first 10,000 programs will be the worst program.
  
  we will start our program from the "hello, world" and then gradually increase the complexity of the program.
